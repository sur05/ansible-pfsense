# ansible-pfsense
WIP ansible module for managing pfsense firewalls.

This is the very early stages of a module to allow you to configure pfsense
firewalls with ansible.

# configuration

The python interpreter is in a non-standard location on pfSense, so you will
need to set:

 ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/local/bin/python2.7

# modules
There are currently the following modules:

* pfsense_alias for managing aliases
* pfsense_authserver_ldap for managing LDAP authentication servers
* pfsense_ca for managing Certificate Authorities
* pfsense_group for managing groups
* pfsense_rule for managing rules

# pfsense_alias
```

# operation

It works by editing /cf/conf/config.xml using xml.etree.ElementTree, then
calling the appropriate php update function via the pfsense php developer
shell.

Some formatting is lost, and CDATA items are converted to normal entries,
but so far no problems with that have been noted.
